## Problem Statement

### Task_v2.0(Group Activity):
 
github.com ---- Clone/Fork a common github repo to your local system 
The basic idea of this task is to understand how collaborated projects work on github 
Terminal: 
After cloning the repo you’ll be given a particular algorithm to implement in your favourite programming language 
Code the algorithm and then push the file to the repository 
Make sure you pull request before pushing your code 
github.com: 
After pushing the code, finally put a pull request 
Your pull request will then be reviewed by the collaborator 
If everything is fine and your mentor is convinced and contented your request will be approved 
Finally, you are now a contributor and you’ve conquered the BATTLEGROUND 
Congrats you are now a git enlightened!!
